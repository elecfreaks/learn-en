The following operating principles should be followed:

2. Do not spill water on the RETRO Arcade body.
3. Do not place the RETRO Arcade in a location where it can be easily dropped.
4. Do not use detergents or water to clean the RETRO Arcade. We recommend that you use a cotton cloth moistened with alcohol to scrub it.
