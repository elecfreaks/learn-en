## Characteristics



 The chip works in a low voltage equipped with 56-byte non-volatile RAM clock calendar
 It has a complete BCD code real-time clock chip, address and data are passed through two-wire bidirectional serial bus, providing information such as seconds, minutes, hours, etc., and can automatically adjust the number of days per month.
 It can automatically set the time of the leap year.
 The chip has built-in power checking circuit that can check the power lost condition and switch the battery.
