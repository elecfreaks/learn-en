# Octopus PM2.5 module(EF04090)

## Introduction

PM2.5 Electronic brick is one of the modules in OCTOPUS series to test the PM2.5 concentration . Based on ZH03 laser dust sensors, it can test the dust particle in the air with high consistency and stability. The PWM output and serial port design also make it easily to operate.
