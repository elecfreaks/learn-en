# Octopus Analog Photocell Brick OBPhotocell(EF04032) 

## Introduction

Photocells are sensors that allow you to detect light. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they often appear in toys, gadgets and appliances.

## Characteristics

 Photocells are basically a resistor that changes its resistive value (in ohms Î©) 
 They have a low cost which is also friendly to the environment.
 Each photocell sensor will act a little differently than the other, even if they are from the same batch.
  For this reason, they shouldn't be used to try to determine precise light levels in lux or millicandela. Instead, you can expect to only be able to determine basic light changes.
 The 3-pins ports is easy to plug and play.
