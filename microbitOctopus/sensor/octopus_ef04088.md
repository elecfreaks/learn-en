# Octopus 2 Channel Tracking Module(EF04088) 

## Introduction
---
Octopus 2 Channel Tracking Module has integrated two groups of reflective infrared pair diode, which can be used to identify black lines. This module is usually used to make line tracking smart cars. We can design black track at will and make our cars follow it through programming. 

## Characteristics
