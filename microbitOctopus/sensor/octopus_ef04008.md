## Introduction
---


- OCTOPUS Sound Sensor is a sensor module based on MIC sound sensing element. Sound Sensor is particularly sensitive to sound intensity,and it can be used to detect ambient sound level, but it can not identify the size of sound and the specific sound frequencies. It is available to make voice switches and other works.
