## Introduction

EL driver module is used for driving the EL or EL panel in the market, the EL is also called the cold light neon tube which is apyretic and water-proof that can also be wound to any shape.  Multiple colors like red, green, blue, yellow, purple, orange, transparent, pink, bisque and white can be found in the market. 
EL (electroluminescence) is a physical phenomenon in which an electric field is generated by a power source applied to two electrodes, and an electron excited by an electric field strikes an illuminating center, causing a transition of an electron level, a change or a combination that causes the luminescence, that is, an electroluminescence phenomenon.
