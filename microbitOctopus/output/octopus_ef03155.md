## Characteristics



 This is a mini OLED display whose diameter is only 1 inch, it is of high resolution due to the  high contrast of the display.
 The display is made of 128x64 white OLED pixels with each on/off by the controlling chip.
 The mini and smart OLED display is of strong  readability due to its high contrast.
 The display does not require backlight selfillumination, it lowers the power for the OLED display to work.
 The loaded voltage regulator and the builtin boost converter made it possible to connect the power in 5V. It is easy to connect to the mini controller in 3V/5V power without any level translator.
