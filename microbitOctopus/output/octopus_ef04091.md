The basic design is upon the OCTOPUS electronic bricks series with the identical design on the outlook, PCB fixed orifices and the connectors of the electronic bricks. The on-board LED is a smart LED and an integration of control circuit and light-emitting circuit, it can be operated under a low voltage with a high luminance and large angle scattering.

## Introduction
---

- With data transmitting in single line and with unlimited concatenation.
- With circuit adjusted by gray level(256 level gray can be adjusted )
- With built-in power on reset and power down reset circuit, the LED doesn't turn on when power off.
- The red led is set through special processing to make the color more balanced.
- The data transmission frequency can reach to 800Kbps. When the refresh rate is 30 frames/second, the number of cascades is over 1024 points.
