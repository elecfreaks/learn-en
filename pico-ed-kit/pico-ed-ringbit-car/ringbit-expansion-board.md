The [Ring:bit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-micro-bit-ring-bit-v2-car-kit-without-micro-bit-board.html) V2 breakout board is a dedicated expansion board designed to increase the expandability of the [Ring:bit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-micro-bit-ring-bit-v2-car-kit-without-micro-bit-board.html) car. The board contains two Rainbow LEDs and a dedicated expansion port for connecting dedicated expansion modules.
There is a sliding switch on the board, toggle the switch to "Rainbow LED" to use the two on-board Rainbow LEDs and toggle the switch to "Other modules" and you can connect other dedicated modules, but you cannot do both at the same time.
