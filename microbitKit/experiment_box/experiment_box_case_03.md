The GND of slot on micro:bit is into innards of batteries' GND to generate current loop.

## Introduction of Components ##

### RGB LED ###
 The RGB LED is an LED that has 3 integrated LEDs  red, green and blue in a single component which is divided into R, G and B channel. It is a wellknown fact that red, green and blue are three primary colors of light. It can mix all color for everything. RGB LED can generate limitless types of color as well.
 There are 2 types of RGB LEDs, common anode and common cathode. In commoncathode RGB LEDs, the
common port connects to GND. While in commonanode RGB LEDs, the common port connects to VCC. 
  Our Experiment Box uses a commoncathode RGB LED.

### Step 2

 Snap digital write pin into on button A pressed as below picture. Write 1 to the P0 port, 0 to the P1 port and 0 to the P2 port.
 It means write 1 to R channel of the RGB and write 0 to G & b channel of the RGB.
 RGB LED is the red light.

## Result

 When the button A be pressed, RGB LED emits red light.
 When the button B be pressed, RGB LED emits green light.
 When the button C be pressed, RGB LED emits blue light.
