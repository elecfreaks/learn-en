 The GND of slot on micro:bit is into innards of batteries' GND to generate current loop.

## Introduction of Components ##

### NTC ###
 The NTC is an analog temperature sensor where the output voltage and temperature form a liner relationship. The higher the temperature, the larger the output voltage.
 The experiment box included a NTC.

 The reading is an analog value of the IO port, we need a formula as above to convert the values into Celsius.


### Step 3

 Set "Temperature" as a variable to store the Celsius.
 As above formula, convert the values of P0 into Celsius.
