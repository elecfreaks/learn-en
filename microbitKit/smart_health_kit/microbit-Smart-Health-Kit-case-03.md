# Case 03: Temperature-controlled Fans


##  Introduction
---

- In a room with high temperature and dry air, our noses and throats are prone to dryness, congestion, pain, and sometimes nosebleeds. Also, people could become irritable, inattentive, poor accuracy and coordination with slower reaction speed in such a enviroment.  What's more, the body temperature regulation mechanism temporarily could become obstructed, and heat accumulation in the body occurs, which could lead to heat stroke easily, thus, a temperature-controlled fan could help a lot.

## Function
---

- Detect the temperature with the DHT11 sensor and display the value on the OLED screen, if the temperature is over the threshold, program to turn on the fan.

***Notice:*** If you met a tip indicating that some codebases would be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or create a new project in the menu. 

## Program 
---
Initialize the OLED display.
