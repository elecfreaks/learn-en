# Case 02: UV Light Detection Device


##  Introduction
---

- The most direct effect of excessive ultraviolet radiation is the gradual darkening of the skin. This is because ultraviolet rays cause a large amount of melanin to deposit in the epidermis, leading to permanent blackening, and the marks are not easy to fade; it will accelerate skin aging over time, about 90% of human skin aging is due to ultraviolet rays. Thus we can make a UV detection device for reminding.

## Function
---

- Detect the UV light intensity with the UV sensor, if the intensity is strong, program to drive the servo to lift the parasol.

***Notice:*** If you met a tip indicating that some codebases would be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or create a new project in the menu. 

## Program 
---

Save the value detected from the UV sensor connecting to P1 as the variable "UV" and display the value on the micro:bit.

Judge if the variable is over 5, if yes, set the servo connecting to P2 to drive to 0°; or to drive to 90°.
