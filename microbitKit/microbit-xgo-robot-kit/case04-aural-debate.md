# Case 04-A Sound-controlled XGO Dog 

## Purpose

Hello, sometimes when we hear beautiful music, we will dance to the rhythm of the music, so the same is true of our good friend XGO, this lesson we use the micro:bit with its own microphone Come and feel the changes in the surrounding sounds so that XGO can dance "happily", then let's start.

## Quick to Start

### Working principle

1. The micro:bit has a built-in microphone sensor. It can detect the volume of the surrounding sound, so as to make different reactions according to different volumes!
2. The program we programmed is that XGO makes different actions according to the level of the surrounding sound.

### Hardware Connections
---
We use a data cable (USB cable) to connect the computer with the micro:bit, I believe you are already very skilled.

## FAQ

If XGO doesn't move, please try adjusting the light intensity. 

## Exploration

How to give more commands to XGO with light intensity?
