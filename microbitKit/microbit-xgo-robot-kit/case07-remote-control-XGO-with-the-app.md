Hello, in this class we are about to learn to program and control XGO, we will make XGO do more interesting things and make it our best friend. In this lesson, we programmed XGO to move forward quickly. Of course, if you want XGO to turn and adjust the code, let's start.

## Control
There are four ways to control the XGO which include the **performance mode**, the **overall mode**, the **single-leg control** and the **servo control**. 

The  **performance mode** has all the preset commands which could control xgo with a low DOFs and a high operability.

The **overall mode** is able to control the speed and directions with a high DOFs and senstive operation.

**Single-leg control** and **servo control** can be controlled with a much smaller granularity for a single leg (left front leg, right front leg, right rear leg, left rear leg), and adjustment of the upper and lower rudder for a single leg. Commonly used for minor adjustments to specific movements.
