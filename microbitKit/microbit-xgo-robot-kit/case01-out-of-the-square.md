# Case 01 - Run in A Square Routine

## Purpose

Hello, in this class we are about to learn to program and control XGO, we will make XGO do more interesting things and make it our best friend. In this lesson, we programmed XGO to move forward quickly. Of course, if you want XGO to turn and adjust the code, let's start.
