# FAQ 06

## Q: The Smart cutebot is powered on normally, but it cannot drive.

A: Please follow the steps below to check:

1. Add a program to drive the car forward on the micro:bit: [Full Speed Forward](https://makecode.microbit.org/_0p45b90iHie1)
2. Test if the car is moving forward after normal boot up
3. If the car can not move forward, please remove the ultrasonic sensor from the car and repeat step 2.
4. If the car can drive normally after taking off the ultrasonic sensor, it is proved that the car is malfunctioning due to the wrong installation of ultrasonic sensor.

**When installing the ultrasonic sensor, please pay attention to distinguish the insertion interface, should be inserted into the SONAR interface**
