## Code


### Step 1
Click "Advanced" in the MakeCode drawer to see more choices.

In order to programme for the Ring:bit Bricks Pack, we need to add an extension. Click  "Extensions" at the bottom of the drawer. Search "servo" in the dialogue box to download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips tell or build a new project. 

### Step 2

While button A being pressed, set the servo connected to P0 port turning 180 degrees; while buttom B being pressed, set the servo connected to P0 port turning 90 degrees.

***Note:*** As the servo we used is in 360 degrees, the "servo" extension in MakeCode is suitable for servos in 180 degrees, therefore, setting the turning angle to 0 degree or 180 degrees will lead to the servo turning clockwisely or anti-clockwisely, and 90 degrees means to stop turning.

### Result 

When button A being pressed, the wiper begins working; while buton B being pressed, the wiper stops working.

## FAQ



## Relevant File 


Parallelogram mechanism: the two cranks as well as the connecting rod and frame are equal in length, their rotation speed and direction are in consistent. 

Reciprocating motion: back and forth on both sides near a certain position.

The displacement of the reciprocating motion is equal to 0 because it is a positive stroke and a negative stroke. Mostly used in mechanical movements, such as pendulum, piston movement, etc.
