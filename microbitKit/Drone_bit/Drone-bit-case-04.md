Turn on the Joystick:bit V2 and the drone, you can send commands via Joystick:bit V2 after its vibration.  
Each command is only working after the Joystick:bit V2 gets vibrated.  
The flying directions could be controlled by the stick.   
Press button to fly the drone and button B to give landing command.  
Press button C to make the drone rotate left in 90 degrees and button F to rotate right in 90 degrees.   
Press button D to add the altitude and E to lower it.
