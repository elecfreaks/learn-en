## Drone:bit Breakthrough
---
- **Optical flow locating, TOF fixing altitude**
    It is a kind of drone in professional grade which is able to hover indoors in a waypoint , with build-in optical flow sensors in high sensitivity and TOF sensors, they help to hover and locate in a more precise way.

- **DIY fun**
    Assemble by yourself, enjoy the fun from DIY.

- **Create your infinite artworks through coding**
    Simple graphical and Python programming, available for complicated flying routines, flying gestures and rolling etc., there are more possibilities waiting to be explored.

- **Safe flying**
    The sealed propeller guards give you a safe flying experience.

##  Self Checking
---
After powering on, the Drone goes to self checking mode, the two blue LEDs would flash first and then two red LEDs flash, then they light up accorading to the checking feedback.

-  Four lights flashing in turn: Fail to connect with the micro:bit or the remote controller. 
- Four lights always on: Normal working
- The front and back two lights flash quickly: Low battery
- Only red lights flash: Self-checking failed

## FAQ
---
Notice: For better locating of the drones, a complicated groud is prefered. If the groud is in single color, the drones might not locate them well.
