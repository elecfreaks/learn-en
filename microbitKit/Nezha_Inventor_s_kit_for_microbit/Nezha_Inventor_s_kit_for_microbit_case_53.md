# Case 53: The Lunar Exploration Vehicle

## Introduction

Since ancient times we have never stopped exploring the Moon, and before the development of spacecraft, we could only see it with the naked eye and with telescopes, but now we want to know more about the Moon. We have built lunar spacecraft and lunar rovers and brought back lunar soil samples, which have allowed us to learn more specific information about the Moon. In this lesson, let's build a simple lunar exploration rover and make a preliminary foray into the great interstellar journey of exploring the Moon.

##  MakeCode Programming

### Step 1

Click “Advanced” in the MakeCode drawer to see more choices.

### Result

As you can see, the lunar rover can turn left and right, stop and back up when we press different buttons of the remote control.
