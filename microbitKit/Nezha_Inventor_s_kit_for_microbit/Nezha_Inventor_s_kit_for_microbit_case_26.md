# Case 26: The Volume Indicator

## Introduction

This is a sound warning device. As we all know, noise pollution seriously affects our lives. If we are exposed to a certain decibel noise for a long time, our physical and mental state will also be harmed. Thus, we can make a noise detection device. Different decibel values light up different colors of lights to remind people to keep quiet.
