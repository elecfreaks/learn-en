### Sample
- Set an icon on the micro:bit display. 
- Save the variable as the distance detected from the TPBot to its front car in the forever brick, judge if the the distance is between 10 and 20(exl. 10&20), if yes, set the speed of both wheels in 0; if the distance is below 10, set the speed of both wheels in -30%; or set the speed both in 30%.

### Conclusion

Power up to show an icon on the micro:bit display and the TPBot keeps a distance to its front car.  It goes slower if the distance detected was close or it goes forward if the distance detected was far; and it stops if the distance detected was between the set interval value.
