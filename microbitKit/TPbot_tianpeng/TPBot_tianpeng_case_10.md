### Sample
- Set an icon on the micro:bit display and the headlights in white. 
- Judge if the black line was detected in the forever brick, if yes, set the TPBot reversing for one second at the speed of 30% and then turning left for 0.5 second at the same speed; or it moves forward at the speed of 30%.
