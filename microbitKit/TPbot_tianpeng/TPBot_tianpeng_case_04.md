### Sample
- Set a triangle in the micro:bit and the TPBot moving forward at the speed of 50%; Set the LED headlights in green. 
- Save the variable of the distance from the TPBot to the obstacle in the forever brick, judge if the items of `i<15` and `iâ‰ 0` are both true, if yes, set TPBot stopping immediately and the headlights flashing three times; set it reversing for 1 second at the speed of 30% and then turning left for 0.5 second at the speed of 30%; finally set the headlights showing green and the TPBot moving forward at the speed of 50%.
