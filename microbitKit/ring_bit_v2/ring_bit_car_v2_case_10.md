# Case 10 Smart Crashproof Car

## Purpose

- Make a smart crashproof car with a Sonar:bit. 

## Materials

- 1 x [Ring:bit Car kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/ring-bit-car-v2-for-micro-bit.html)
- 1 x micro:bit 
- 1 x [Sonar:bit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/ring-bit-car-accessories-sonar-bit-tracking-module-and-led-light-bar.html)


## Hardware Connection

- Connect the left servo to P1, right servo to P2 and Sonar:bit to P0 of the Ring:bit.

## Software Programming

[Microsoft makecode online coding https://makecode.microbit.org/#](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)

## Software

### Step 1
- Click "Advanced" in the drawer of MakeCode to see more choices.

- We need to add a package for programming the kit. Click "Extensions" in the drawer and search “ringbit" in the dialogue box to download it.

- We also need to add a package for programming the Sonar:bit. Click "Extensions" in the drawer and search “`https://github.com/elecfreaks/pxt-sonarbit`" in the dialogue box to download it. 

***Note:***  if you are informed that it will be deleted due to incompatibility of the codebase, you can go on with the tips or create a new project in the menu.

### Step 2

- Drag the pins selection bricks for servos in the `On start` brick, the pins numbers are set according to the actual connection port.
- Move forward at full speed.

### Step 3

- Set variate `sonar` in the `forever` brick and read the detected value from the Sonar:bit to it. 
- Drag the `if` brick and judge if the value given by `sonar` is below 10 and not equal to 0. 
- If yes, set the speed of right wheel to 100 and the left to 0 to turn left with 500ms for obstacle avoidance. 
- If not, move forward at full speed.

## Result 


- The Ring:bit car turns left automatically when detecting any obstacle 10cm in front of it.

## Exploration


- Question: Why we need to judge if the value is not 0 ?
- Answer: The detection value is also 0 if beyond the detection scope of Sonar:bit.
