# Sonar:bit

## Introduction

- [Sonar:bit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/ring-bit-car-accessories-sonar-bit-tracking-module-and-led-light-bar.html) is a 3-wire ultrasonic module with the working voltage between 3-5V.  It is available to be used to 3.3V or 5V micro-controller system. With only one 3-wire(GVS) cable, it can work properly. Compared to the normal 4-wire ultrasonic module, it has saved one IO port. The measurement range of sonar:bit is 4cm-400cm. It can output stable and accurate measurement data with Â±1cm tolerance only. 
- It can connect to the Ring:bit with an expansion board.

## Characteristics

- Input voltage:3V~5V  and can be driven by micro:bit directly.
- Standard 3-wire GVS connecotr, which occupies 1 IO port only.
