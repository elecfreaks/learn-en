# sensor:bit Introduction

## Introduction


Sensor:bit is a breakout board based on micro:bit. It has extended all available IO ports on micro:bit, and lead out them in the form of GVS. With this board, we can extend various 3V electric brick modules like LED light, photocell, etc.. On the board, it has integrated a buzzer and an audio jack, which allows us to hear music from the buzzer or with our headphone.
