## Goal



 Make a smart wardrobe

## Materials


1 x [ELECFREAKS micro:bit Smart Home Kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/micro-bit-smart-home-kit.html)
 1 x corrugated board

## Background

### What is smart wardrobe
 Smart wardrobe could automatically open and let people take cloth. A slight push and the door open.At the same time, wardrobe door was setted low noise, it will not disturb sleep.

### Smart wardrobe operation
 Controling crash detect module using micro:bit and receive crash signal.The micro:bit will control servo to open the door with light up when it received signal.

## Programming

### Step 1
Go to MakeCode page, click Advanced in the code block and click on Extensions.

***Note:*** If there is a hint says some codebase will be deleted because of incompatibility. Don't worry. You could go ahead as the hint or build a new item in item menu bar.


### Step 2

Drag on start from Basic and snap into set pull pin P2 to up.

Drag servo write pin from Pin, choose P7, set P7 to 180° and set door to -1 for closing the door。

If door variables is false, servo turns 180° with door closes, pause 2 seconds and the rainbow
LED off.
