## Goal



 Make a water level alarming.

## Materials


1 x [ELECFREAKS micro:bit Smart Home Kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/micro-bit-smart-home-kit.html)
 1 x tank

## Background

### What is water level alarming 
 We can't live without water, but much water will cause flood. Water level alarming can detect water level, micro:bit will received signals when the water level over security line and control lift pump to pumping.

### Water level alarming operation
 When micro：bit received signal of soil moisture sensor,relay will drive and supply power to lift pump for pumping redundant water.

## Programming

### Step 1
Go to MakeCode page, click Advanced in the code block and click on Extensions.

***Note:*** If there is a hint says some codebase will be deleted because of incompatibility. Don't worry. You could go ahead as the hint or build a new item in item menu bar.

### Step 2

Snap if statement into forever,set analog read pin P2 > 500, that's say when P2 > 500, the water level is higher than security line.

### Step 3

Set start melody "ba ding" repeating once as alarming voice, set digital write pin P1 to 1 as driving the pumping.

### Step 4
Else，set digital write pin P1 to 0 as turning off the pump.
