# Case 08: Auto Pick-up Device


##  Introduction
---

- In the normal pick-up of the nut fruits, we usually use a stick to chop the branches to get the mature fruits, which could do a bad harm to the leaves and branches,thus, we can make an auto pick-up device by shaking the trunk of the tree. 

##  Function
---
- Shake the trunk of the tree to get the fruits.
