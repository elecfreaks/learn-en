# Case 05: Water Temperature Detection 


##  Introduction
---

- Fishes are poikilotherm whose body temperature changes as the ambient water temperature changes, thus, the water temperature plays a vital role in the growth of fishes. 

##  Function
---
- Dectect the water temperature with the DS18B20 sensor and display them on OLED screen.
