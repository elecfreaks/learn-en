***Notice:*** If you met a tip indicating that some codebases would be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or create a new project in the menu. 

## Program

---

Drag the on start block from the drawer, initialize the strip connecting to P9 with 1 led.

Set to connect the sonar:bit to P1 with unit "cm" and the PIR sensor to P2, save the returned values as the variable "ultrasonic_distance" and the variable "IR" accordingly.

Judge if the variable "ultrasonic_distance" is in the threshold, if yes, judge if the variable "IR" is 1, if yes, set the strip to show red and the buzzer to alarm; or turn the lights off.

If the variable "ultrasonic_distance" is not in the threshold, program to turn off it light.
