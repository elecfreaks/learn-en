# motor:bit Introduction 

## Introduction


Motor:bit is a motor driving board based on micro:bit. It has integrated a TB6612 motor driving chip, which is used to drive two motors with maximun 1.2A DC single channel current. It has also integrated 12 GVS ports(for connecting OCTOPUS series of electric bricks) and 1 IIC communication port. These ports allow you to extend with various sensors and electric modules. On the board, P3-P7, P9-P10 are IO ports for directly driving 3.3V devices; P13-P16, P19-P20(IIC port) support 3.3V/5V voltage switch. Sliding the voltage switch onboard, it is available to drive 3.3V or 5V devices. Besides, you can play music with the buzzer on motor:bit. Motor:bit is totally designed for DIYers. You can use it to create your own smart car or more funny projects.

## Introduction of Major Components


### M1-M2 Motor Connector

![](./images/29nn8kR.jpg)

M1 and M2 can separately connect a DC motor with max current of 1.2A. 

### Passive Buzzer

Slide the switch to 5V, then VCC supply 5V power; slide the switch to 3.3V, then it provide 3.3V power. This switch is valid to 6 IO ports only: P13, P14, P15, P16, P19, P20. 

### G-VCC-S Standard GVS Port
