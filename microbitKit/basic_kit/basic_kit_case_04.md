## Software


[makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)





## Programming

### Step 1

Under "on start"，set pull pin P2 to up to keep signal stable. Set servo write pin P1 to 180, then the sticker board is at rest.

Set door as a variable, and its initial value is false for saving status of sticker board.

### Step 2

Under forever, snap if statement to judge if the P2 port is equal to 0, it means if the sensor switch is pressed.

When the value P2 port is equal to 2, the sensor switch is pressed, set variable door to not door.

Then, snap another if statement to control the value of varible door, which means to judge the status of the door. If variable door is equal to true, then the sticker board will move(P1=0).
