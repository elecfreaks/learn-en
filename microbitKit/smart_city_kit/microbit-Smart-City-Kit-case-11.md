# Case 11: Smart Lamps for Basketball Courts


##  Introduction 
---

- In the city, there are places for citizens to exercise, such as basketball courts. Whenever it is night, the basketball court will always turn on the lights, thus, we can make a smart lighting that will automatically turn on the lights when it detects that someone is moving on the basketball court, otherwise it will automatically turn off the lights.


##  Function 
---

- Light on the lamps if there are people on the basketball courts and turn off the lamps if there is no one there.
