***Notice:*** If you met a tip indicating that some codebases would be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or create a new project in the menu. 

## Program

Turn on the lights in accordance with the micro:bit status, if the micro:bit logo faces upwards it means the nest is in a normal status with the green led turnning on; if the yellow led lights on, it means the micro:bit is in a tilted status which means the nest is tilting to the left/right side; or the red means the nest is upside down now and it requires a re-construction.
