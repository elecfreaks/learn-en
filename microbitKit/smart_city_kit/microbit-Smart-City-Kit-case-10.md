# Case 10: Push-button Crosswalk Traffic Lights


##  Introduction 
---

- Traffic ights enable effective traffic control, and have obvious effects on diverting traffic flow, improving road capacity, and reducing traffic accidents. But when there are no pedestrians to pass, the red light will reduce the driving efficiency, so we can make a push-button crosswalk traffic light. When someone needs to cross the road, press the button to triggering the green lights. 


##  Function 
---
- Press the button to activate the auto-timer for lighting on the equivalent traffic lights.
