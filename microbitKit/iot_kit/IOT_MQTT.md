For hardware connections, please refer to our wiki: [https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitKit/iot_kit/iot_bit.html](https://www.elecfreaks.com/learn-en/microbitKit/iot_kit/iot_bit.html)

**Attention:** Please use the USB port on the IoT:bit for power supply, or the Wifi module would not get powered. 

Go to MakeCode: [https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)

Click "Advanced" in the MakeCode drawer to see more choices, and then click "Extensions".

Choose "ESP8266_IoT".

![](./images/IOT_HiveMQ_13.png)

In the on start block, initialize esp8266 and enter with the name and password of the wifi for connecting.

 Set the applications of MQTT, set "scheme" as "TSL", self-define "clientID", add the user name and password with the one on HiveMQ.

Click "Overview" and copy the "Host" and "port" to MakeCode. 

![](./images/IOT_HiveMQ_16.png)

Click "Getting started",  choose "HiveMQ Websocket Client".

A notice of "connected" labled in green occurs if the connection is made successfully. 

Click "Add New Topic Subscription" .

If completed, it is ok to send messages from MakeCode. 

The "hello" in the block is the message we are going to send, you can set it by yourself. And the topic block: "testtopic/1" is the pre-settings on the platform, you can replace "#" with any number.

Following the former steps, press the button A on micro:bit to send "hello" to the platform. 

![](./images/IOT_HiveMQ_23.png)

Absolutely, we can send data from the platform to local part, set the topic as "testtopic/2", and enter the messages  on "Message", then click "Publish" to send. 
And make sure to keep the topic in the blocks the same.

Send the number "2" from the platform and display it on the micro:bit.
