## Introduction


Temperature sensor is a kind of sensor that can detect temperature and transfer it into output data. Temperature sensor is the core component of temperature gauges and instruments with multiple categories. In this experiment, we are going to learn analog temperature sensor--TMP36 and display its data on micro:bit.

## Components List


### Hardware:
- 1 x micro:bit Board
- 1 x Micro-B USB Cable
- 1 x microbit Breadboard Adapter
- 1 x Transparent Breadboard - 83 * 55 mm
- 1 x TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- n x Breadborad Jumper Wire 65pcs Pack

## Major Components Introduction

### TMP36

TMP36 is a kind of analog temperature sensor. Its output voltage and temperature forms a linear relationship. That means higher temperature will have bigger output voltage.

**Note:**
When we look at the front side marked “TMP36”, the left side pin of the chip is VCC, middle is Vout, and the right side pin is GND. Do not connect it wrong or the components connected might be damaged.

We can know from the above chart that the temperature formula is:

Temperature（℃）=(Output Voltage（mV）-500)/10

## Experimental Procedure

### Hardware Connection
Connect your components according to the picture below:

- 1.Connect the sensor to P0 port of the breadboard adapter.

### Details for the code:
- 1.Use the "map" function to confirm a value between 0~1023 with the value detected by the sensor through P0 port, then save it in voltage.
- 2.Transforming the value saved in voltage into temperature and show it on the micro:bit.
