## Introduction

---
In our blog micro:bit Experiment 04: Photocell — Elecfreaks mirco: bit [Starter Kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/micro-bit-starter-kit.html)  Course”, we had connected a photocell externally to sense the light. Actually, micro:bit has integrated a light detection device internally. Today we are going to use the internal light sensor to do an experiment. We will light a rainbow LED ring when the light in the outer environment is comparatively dark.

## Major Component Introduction
---
You might be curious about how micro:bit senses light without any light sensor. Let’s see a paragraph about display on micro:bit website:

The display is a 5x5 array of LEDs. It is connected to the micro:bit as a 3x9 matrix. Runtime software repeatedly refreshes this matrix at a high speed, such that it is within the user persistence of vision range, and no flicker is detected. This LED matrix is also used to sense ambient light, by repeatedly switching some of the LED drive pins into inputs and sampling the voltage decay time, which is roughly proportional to ambient light levels.

That’s really amazing! Except for its light emitting ability, micro:bit can sense light!Because LEDs are so commonly used as light emitters it is easy to forget that they are fundamentally photodiodes, and as such are light detectors as well.The function may be implemented with no additional hardware cost if incorporated in the LED driver circuit.

### Details for the code:
- 1.Set P0 port as the output of the ring signal and set the color mode to RGB.

- 2.When the light level received by micro:bit is lower than 10, the ring lights on in many colors.

## Result
---
When in darkness, the LED ring will be turned on; while in brightness, the LED ring will be turned off.

## Exploration
---
If we want to rotate the rainbow color after the ring is illuminated, then how to design circuit and program?
