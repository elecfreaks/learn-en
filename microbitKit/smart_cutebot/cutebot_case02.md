# Case 02: Speed Up Gradually

## Purpose
---
- In case 01, we can find the  [Cutebot](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-micro-bit-smart-cutebot-kit-without-micro-bit-board?_pos=1&_sid=4c6909119&_ss=r) moves too fast to go steadily(the universal wheel goes off the ground) at the beginning.
- We will learn to gradually speed up the car for a steady move at the beginning in this case.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating incompatibility of the codebase, you can continue with the tips or build a new project there.

### Step 2

- Choose "show icon" in the `On start`brick.
- Set the `speed` variable to 0 which means the on start speed is 0.

### Step 3

- Drag setting speed bricks for left and right wheel and set the value as `speed` in "forever" brick, then add one to `speed`.
- If `speed` is `100` which is the maximum speed, set `speed` to 0 and restart it.
