### Step 3

- Drag `if` brick into `forever` brick and judge if both of the line-tracking sensors are detecting the edges of the black line, then set the right wheel speed to `20`. 
- If not, set the speed of both wheels as `-50` to reverse, pause `300ms` and keep the left wheel still but the right wheel moves at a random speed from 50~100 and lasts 100ms.
- Set the speed of both wheels to 0 and pause 1s to move forward again.
