***Tips:*** the bricks holder here is flexible to be adjusted, we may manually adjust the angles of the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) to meet the requirements of the functions that you want to achieve.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the “on start” brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) and switch the function to the color recognition mode, set the RainbowLED lights connect to P15 port.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) and judge the cards color on the image. If it reconizes the white color, we set the LED headlights and signal lights in white; if we recognizes the blue color, we set the LED headlights and signal lights in blue, by analogy, we programme with green, red, yellow and black card in the same way.
