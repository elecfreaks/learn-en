### Step 1
- Click “Advanced” in the drawer to see more choices.

- We need to add a package for programming the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) kit. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “PlanetX-AI” in the dialogue box to download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the “on start” brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) and switch the function to the line tracking mode, set the micro:bit to display the appointed icon.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit?_pos=1&_sid=dcae9d30c&_ss=r) and judge the deviation direction of the line on the image. If it deviates to the left side, it means the car deviates to the right, we should set the speed of the left wheel at the speed of 10% and the right at 40% to make the car turn left and go to the right way; if the line deviates to the right side, it means the car deviates to the left side, now we should set the speed of the right wheel at the speed of 10% and the left at 40% to make the car turn right and go to the right way; or we may set the speed of both wheels at 20% and the car moves forward with the line.
