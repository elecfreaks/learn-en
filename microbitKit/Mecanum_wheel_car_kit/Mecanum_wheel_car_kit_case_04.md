### Step 4

Set the variable `L` and `R` to a random number between 0~100 and judge their numerical value. If the value of R is more than that of the L, set LED as 0 in black and 1 in yellow; or set LED as 1 in black and 0 in yellow. Then refresh the LED. Next step is to assign the value of  variable `L` to the speed of the front&rear wheels on the left side and the value of variable `R` to the speed of the front&rear wheels on the right side, and pause 2000 ms.
