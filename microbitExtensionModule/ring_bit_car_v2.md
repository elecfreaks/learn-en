The ELECFREAKS Ring:bit Car is a small DIY smart car driven by the BBC micro:bit and the ELECFREAKS Ring:bit.

A basic Ring:bit Car can be easily programmed to run autonomously, with a remote control, and even create rainbow beacons of light. Just add one of the many extensions available and your Ring:bit Car can do even more things like line and light following, obstacle avoiding, drawing and more!
