# 3 in 1 Breakout Board

## Introduction
---

The [Arduino 3 in 1 Breakout board](https://www.elecfreaks.com/arduino-3-in-1-master-control-box.html) is a programmable masterboard based on ATMEGA328P, it is loaded with the dual drive servo connections, the dual drive motor connections and 8-way connections for sensors; all the sensor connections are in RJ11 type with fool-proof and anti-plug design; it is also loaded with Lego compatible ports on the shells which make them possible to connect the modules with Lego bricks.

### Program

Cotrol the servos and motors through the breakout board. 
```
#include <USmart.h>
USmart device;
void setup() {
  device.begin();   //initialize the buzzer, motor and light. 
}
void loop() {
  device.setMotorSpeed(M1,60);  // Set the speed of motor, speed in percentage, scope: -100~+100
  device.setMotorSpeed(M2,60);
  device.setServoAngle(S1,180);  //Set the angles of servos 
  delay(2000);
  device.setServoAngle(S2,180);
  delay(2000);
  device.setServoAngle(S1,0);
  delay(2000);
  device.setServoAngle(S2,0);
  delay(2000);
}
```
