# ELECFREAKS TOOCA Laser 1 Firmware Update Method

## Firmware update method
1. Prepare a TF card with a capacity larger than the firmware size, e.g. 8G TF card.
2. Put the firmware (TOOCA_Laser_1_20220802_Release.bin) that needs to be updated into the TF card.
3. Insert the TF card into the card slot.
4. Reboot the device.
5. After waiting for 3-5 seconds, the device will beep, indicating that the update is in progress, and the beep will end when the update is complete.

**Note:**
- **The firmware update time is about 3-30 seconds, depending on the firmware size and TF card quality.**
- **Do not operate the device during the firmware update process and do not turn off the power to the device, otherwise, it will cause serious consequences of product damage.**
