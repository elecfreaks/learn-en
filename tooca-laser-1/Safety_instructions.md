## Safety Instructions

Before operating TOOCA laser, please read and familiarize yourself with all usage precautions. The user should strictly observe all safety precautions and make sure TOOCA is properly assembled and in normal working condition.
Please follow the following operating principles：

1. Before each operation, be sure to check the TOOCA Laser 1 for damage. Do not operate damaged or defective machines in any way.
2. Do not disassemble or in any other way alter the structure of the TOOCA Laser 1. Do not modify or decompile the operating system of the TOOCA Laser 1 by yourself.
3. Do not leave the TOOCA Laser 1 unattended during operation.
4. The residues and chips accumulated from cutting and engraving are dangerous and may cause fire, so please clean the chips and residues from honeycomb panels regularly.
5. The laser works in an ambient temperature of 5°C-25°C and is strictly prohibited to operate at sub-zero temperatures.
6. Do not engrave or cut any material containing PVC or vinyl (plastic is not recommended). These materials (and other chlorine/chlorine containing materials) produce corrosive vapors that are extremely harmful and can cause damage to the machine.
7. Do not engrave or cut any unknown material. Vaporization/melting of many materials, including but not limited to PVC and polycarbonate, can emit harmful fumes.
8. Keep the area around TOOCA Laser 1 clean and free of cluttered flammable materials, explosives or volatile solvents such as acetone, alcohol or gasoline. Have a fire extinguisher on standby. Maintain and inspect fire extinguishers regularly.
