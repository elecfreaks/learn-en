# MQ3 Gas Sensor(EF05032)

## Introduction

The MQ3 Gas sensor is tin dioxide (SnO2), which has a low conductivity in clean air. While the sensor being put in an environment that exists the alcohol vapor, the electrical conductivity of the sensor increases as the concentration of alcohol gas in the air increases.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu. 

### Step 2

### Code as below:

### Result
 The value detected from MQ3 Gas sensor displays on the OLED screen.

## Python Programming 


### Step 1

Download the package and unzip it: [PlanetX_MicroPython](https://github.com/lionyhw/PlanetX_MicroPython/archive/master.zip)

Go to  [Python editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/2.0)

### Step 2

### Reference

```
from microbit import *
from enum import *
from ethanol import *
ethanol = ETHANOL(J1)
while True:
    display.scroll(ethanol.get_ethanol())
```


### Result
 The value detected from MQ3 Gas sensor displays on the micro:bit.
