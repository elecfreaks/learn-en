### Result
 The value detected from MQ5 Gas sensor displays on the OLED screen.

## Python Programming 


### Step 1

Download the package and unzip it: [PlanetX_MicroPython](https://github.com/lionyhw/PlanetX_MicroPython/archive/master.zip)

Go to  [Python editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/2.0)

### Step 2

### Reference

```
from microbit import *
from enum import *
from co import *
co = CO(J1)
while True:
    display.scroll(co.get_co())
```


### Result
 The value detected from MQ5 Gas sensor displays on the micro:bit.
